                            Our objective with this project is to analyze the music industry using data from Spotify and Genius. We want to try to visualize a network of musicians from all types of music, find hidden structure in the music industry, and try to gain new insights into the different genres as well as develop a tool to discover and explore new music. We want to see if we can relate the network structure to genres, lyrical sentiment, and other characteristics in the data. We will look into lyrical themes to identify patterns for certain topics and genres.

                            The dataset used for the network is rather large. We decided to use a subset of artists that consists of the most popular artists and the most followed artists on Spotify.<br><br>

                            In our network, every artist is represented as a node. The edges between them are created using a feature in Spotify called “related artists”, that connects an artist to a set of other artists which people might also like.<br><br>
                            
                            The total network contains 4,031 nodes and 35,192 edges.

                            To analyze the communities even further, the artists’ nodes in the network are colored by the community they belong to. For each node, you can explore the artist’s <i>name</i>, Spotify’s <i>popularity</i> score, the number of <i>followers</i>, and <i>other artists</i> the musician is linked to. The size of each node is determined by the amount of followers the artist has. That way, the largest nodes become the artists that most people are familiar with. The biggest ones are Ed Sheeran, Drake, Eminem, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Ariana Grande.

The smaller connected components, bottom right of the figure, consist of more obscure, diverse genres from all around the world such as Indian Bollywood artists, Afropop, and Japanese rock. The largest connected component contains more mainstream genres like pop, rock, rap, hip hop and more.

The bright yellow community looks like an emo/punk/rock cluster with artists like Marilyn Manson and Linkin Park. The gold-brown community includes the old-school rock and rollers - Queen, Pink Floyd and the Beatles. Blue is obviously rappers, consisting of Drake, Eminem and Kanye West.

                            Let’s take a closer look at the largest connected component, this time we will generate a network with a different approach. We’ll spatialize the network using the Force Atlas 2 layout, with strong gravity so that we can view all the nodes at the same time. The nodes are colored according to their community. Due to the layout, adjacent communities are more related than communities that are far apart. Additionally, the internal position of every node within a community represents how related it is to the surrounding communities.

                            From the figure above, we can see that Queen and Elvis Presley are in the same community.

                            Betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes. Therefore, nodes with high betweenness play a vital role when it comes to connecting the whole network. Without them, disruption might occur in links between nodes, as they dominate the shortest paths between the nodes.

                            The graphs show a slight downward trend. Two explanations come to mind, one being that music has slowly become sadder over time. The other explanation is one of sample bias.

                            Before we dive into the text analysis let’s quickly stop to think about a metric called TF-IDF. TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency and is a metric for the <strong>relative importance of a word in a given song</strong>. It considers how many times the word appears in the given song (term frequency) as well as how many other songs the word appears in (document frequency). The more common the word, the less important it is, the more often the word appears, the more important it is.

                            For this section, we first computed the TF-IDF for each word in every single one of our >10.000 songs. Then, because we don’t want longer songs to count more than shorter songs, we give each song a combined weight of 1.

                            Having seen the difference between some genres from the sentimental analysis, we want to show what’s actually behind the difference in these numbers. For this calculate the average TF-IDF value for each genre and then create word clouds where the size of the words is proportional to the weight of the given word. Let’s first look at the separate extremes of the sentiment spectrum: contemporary Christian music (ccm) and underground hip hop.                        </p>

                            The word clouds definitely tell a story. The ccm word cloud is filled with religious words and the underground hip hop word cloud is filled with curse words and derogatory terms. However, most genres are probably not as extreme as these two cases. Let’s look at 10 dissimilar genres from the top 25 most popular ones and try to see if the themes make sense.

                            Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a method designed to extract patterns or ‘parts’ from high-dimensional data, such as the TF-IDF data we have here. These patterns should present themselves as exaggerated topics of songs. Examples of these might be a 'love song' topic or a 'nostalgic' topic. Such topics would be described as weights for each word. The higher the weights, the more likely the word is to be present in the topic. For the 'love song' topic, we might expect to see high weights for words such as 'love', 'miss', and 'need' since these are common in such songs.

                            Looking at the two extracted topics, we see an unsettling reality about the message being sent by the music industry regarding gender roles. We see that words associated with girls are those that indicate objectification and demeaning viewpoints regarding women. Then we see a stark contrast when we look at the word cloud where ‘boy’ appears. This word cloud shows a narrative of adventure with words like ‘special’, ‘jungle’, ‘jewel’ and ‘horses’. These results didn’t really surprise us, since this is a known problem in the world and especially in the music industry, but it was still a bit shocking to see this layed out so clearly and emerging from data rather than opinions and articles.                         </p>

            <p>The happiest genre is <strong>contemporary Christian music (ccm)</strong> which might not come as a surprise since many of those songs contain high rated happy words such as lord, Jesus, and holy.</p>
            <p><strong>Funk</strong> is a danceable form of music with a mixture of soul, jazz, and rhythm and blues. The songs often have a good vibe.</p>

            <p>The sad genres are sensible. The genres are influenced by dark emotions and the music is often used to express a judgement. </p>
            <p><strong>Underground hip hop</strong> is known for its socially conscious lyrics. <strong>Trap</strong> gets its name from a slang word that refers to a place where drugs are sold illegally.<strong> Alternative metal</strong> is driven by aggressive sounds and the lyrics are often progressive.</p>
